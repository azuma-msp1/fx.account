			<h2>2. Open an XMTrading account</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Among the many Forex brokers, here I will introduce how to open an account with XMTrading.<br>
					<br>
					The advantages of choosing XM are as follows.<br>
					・ Reliable because it is a major broker used by traders globally<br>
					・ Automatic trading is available<br>
					・ Abundant benefits such as account opening bonus, deposit bonus, loyalty points, etc.<br>
					・ Because there are affiliates, it has the potential to further increase profits.<br>

					<br>
					Opening an account is very easy. For those who are worried about investing their money in automatic trading from the beginning, it is a good idea to open a demo account and test automatic trading without spending money. First, click the link below to open the XM account opening page.<br>

				<h3>Step 1: Personal Details and Trading Account Details</h3>
					<br>

					<br>
				<p>
					I think you will have no problem with filling "Personal Details" but you might be confused about "Trading Account Details".<br>
					<br>
					"Trading Platform Type" can be either MT4 or MT5, but I am using the newer trading platform MT5. Since MT4 has existed for a long time, there are a lot of types of automatic trading tools (EA), but I do not feel any inconvenience even with MT5 EA, so here I will introduce the case of MT5.<br>
					<br>
					"Account Type" has to be chosen the following three types: standard, micro, and zero. I recommend a standard account.<br>
					<br>
					Click "PROCEED TO STEP 2".<br>

				<h3>Step 2 : More Detail Infomation</h3>

					You will have no problem with filling "Personal Details" and "Address Details".<br>
					<br>
				</p>
				<img src="./img/registration_03.jpg" alt="" class="screenshot"><br>
				<br>
				<p>
					"Account Base Currency": Choose currency you always use.<br>
					"Leverage": The maximum leverage of 1: 888 is recommended.<br>
					"Account Bonus": Select "Yes" here. If you select "No", you will not receive the bonus.<br>
					<br>
